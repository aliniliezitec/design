      Goal: Communicate use cases of our product through use of locations
      <br><br>
      Select locations for unique appearance, character, and feelâ€”background
      colors are a plus. Yet locations do not need to be identifiable, and may seem
      familiar to people from a range of places
      <br><br>
      Do not include monuments that a tourist would pose in front of
      <br><br>
      Scenes should capture the least amount of elements to convey the story
      <br><br>
      Avoid cluttered or visually busy elements that distract from the subject
      <br><br>
      Subjects should be engaging with their environment, not just posing in front of it
    </p>
